## User testing guide

* Submit atomic comments using GitHub issues
* Label usage guide:

| Issue label | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `bug` | application does not work correctly |
| `needs doc` | aplication feature may be nonintuitive should be documented |
| `enchancement` | requests for new features |
| `question` | topics not directly related to development requests |
